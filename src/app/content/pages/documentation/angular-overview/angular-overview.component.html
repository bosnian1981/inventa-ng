      <p><span class="text-primary">Angular</span> is an open-source front-end framework developed by Google for creating dynamic, modern web apps.</p>
      <p>Angular helps build interactive and dynamic single page applications (SPAs) with its compelling features including templating, two-way binding, modularization, RESTful API handling, dependency injection, and AJAX handling.</p>

        <p>Angular/TypeScript duo is one of the most productive ways of developing mid-to-large size Web applications that can run in any modern Web browser as well as on mobile platform.</p>
        <p>Below are some of benefits of choosing Angular:</p>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mt-3">

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Supported by Google</span> - One of the biggest advantage of Angular is that it is supported by Google. The best part about it is Google’s Long-Term Support (LTS).</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">TypeScript</span> - Angular applications are built using TypeScript language, a superscript for JavaScript, which ensures higher security as it supports types (primitives, interfaces, etc.). It helps catch and eliminate errors early when writing the code or performing maintenance tasks. </p>
                <p>You can find more infomation about TypeScript at: <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" class="text-secondary" target="_blank">typescriptlang.org</a></p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Modular Structure</span> - Angular organizes code into buckets, whether it is components, directives, pipes, or services. Those who are familiar with Angular refer to these buckets as modules. Modules make application functionality organization easy, segregating it into features and reusable chunks. Modules also allow for lazy loading, which paves way for application feature loading in the background or on-demand.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Code Consistency</span> - Consistent coding has several benefits, such as it makes sites easier to use and enables the use of templates or pre-defined code snippets.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Easy Testing</span> - In Angular, testing is extremely simple. Angular.js modules has the application parts, which are easy to manipulate. With module separation, you can load the necessary services, while effectively performing automatic testing. You don’t even need to remember module loading order if you follow “one file-one module” principle.</p>

        <p><span class="text-primary">Command Line Interface (CLI)</span> comes with commands that help us create and start on our project very fast. </p>

        <p>The Angular CLI helps with:</p>

        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mt-3">

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Bootstrapping a project</span> - It creates the initial project structure with a root NgModule and a root component and bootstraps it using the <code>platformBootstrapDynamic</code> method.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Serving and live reloading</span> - The CLI starts a local web-server so we can view our application in the browser via localhost:4200. </p>
                <p>The CLI also watches for any changes to our files and automatically reloads the webpage if there are any.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Code generation</span> - Using the CLI we can create components directives, services, pipes etc…​ all from the command line with all the necessary files, folders and boilerplate code included.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Testing</span> - The generated code also comes with bootstrapped jasmine test spec files, we can use the CLI to compile and run all the tests with a single command.</p>
                <p>Whenever the CLI detects changes to any file it re-runs all the tests automatically in the background.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p><span class="text-primary">Packaging and releasing</span> - The CLI doesn’t just stop with development, using it we can also package our application ready for release to a server.</p>
